# Growth-2325

## Project Description

Growth-2325 is a marketing campaign launched by the founders and team of UERII to create a community. We aim to promote transparency and encourage contribution by publishing the synchronization services of the reserved area. These services will reflect the data present in the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains for the amount of tokens present in the wallets. We provide daily data update services to ensure that the information is up-to-date and accurate.
